### 2025-07-17 - Docker Extraction Strategy Clarification (Agent: Assistant)

#### Completed Tasks:
1. **Docker Image Extraction Clarification** ✅
   - Clarified that we're extracting from both Docker images in the Dockerfile:
     - `lscr.io/linuxserver/xvfb:ubuntunoble` - Custom Xvfb binary with DRI3 support
     - `ghcr.io/linuxserver/baseimage-alpine:3.21` - Pre-built Selkies frontend components
   - Updated documentation to distinguish between Docker extraction and source builds

2. **Documentation Updates** ✅
   - Updated OVERVIEW.md Implementation Approach section
   - Updated ARCHITECTURE.md Selkies installation process
   - Reorganized build process into "Docker Image Extractions" and "Source Builds" sections

#### Key Clarifications:
- **Docker Extraction**: Both upstream Docker images provide pre-built components
- **Frontend Build**: Avoid complex npm build process by extracting from Alpine image
- **Xvfb Binary**: Custom patched binary extracted from dedicated xvfb image
- **Source Builds**: Still required for Python packages and C libraries not in Docker images

#### Implementation Benefits:
- **Reduced Build Complexity**: Leverage pre-built frontend instead of npm compilation
- **Reliable Components**: Use tested builds from LinuxServer.io images
- **Faster Installation**: Skip lengthy frontend compilation process
- **Maintainability**: Track upstream image updates instead of managing build processes

   - Updated total project estimate from 11-16 hours to 15-22 hours
   - Added complexity risks to component documentation

#### Key Findings:
- **Package Installation**: 60+ packages required including graphics, audio, X11, container runtime
- **Build Processes**: Multiple custom builds required (frontend, interposer, fake udev)
- **System Configuration**: Extensive configuration of OpenBox, users, Docker-in-Docker, locales
- **Multi-stage Builds**: Complex extraction and compilation processes
- **Environment Variables**: 8 critical environment variables for proper operation

#### Implementation Reality:
- The "simplified implementation strategy" was based on incomplete analysis
- Actual implementation requires faithful reproduction of complex Docker build processes
- Significant custom compilation is required alongside Docker image extraction
- System configuration tasks are extensive and critical for functionality

#### Updated Estimates:
- **Selkies Component**: 8-12 hours (was 4-6 hours)
